Bring back the old Stats link in the Jetpack menu.

== Description ==

Bring back the old Stats link in the Jetpack menu. That menu item was removed in Jetpack 4.3. There are now different ways to access your stats:

**To access old stats:**

* You can click on the "View All" button in the Stats dashboard widget.
* You can click on "View Old Stats" in the new Jetpack dashboard.

It's worth noting that Old Stats miss some elements, like Insights or geographical stats.

**To access new stats on WordPress.com**

* Click on "View More Stats on WordPress.com" in the new Jetpack dashboard, under Jetpack > Dashboard.
